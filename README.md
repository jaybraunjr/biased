# biased
set up and protocol for metaD and US


- still in development:

# Files/modules:
- index_numbers.py: Creates indexing for COM or other reference atom for PLUMED metaD input files
- meta_d.py: called on to create the metaD file for PLUMED
- setwindow.py: creates windows for US at specific intervals / distances

Interface will be ran through another .py file to call on the modules, or through jupyter notebook

to do:
- [ ] Create jupyter notebook example to call on modules for either US or metaD
